# 2022-Embedded-Challenge-NYU
Spring 2022 Embedded Challenge at NYU - Blood Pressure/Heart Rate Monitor

To run this project, Platform IO is needed

I have designed for this micro-controller to use SPI protocol to read pressure data from the pressure sensor. 
Change code accordingly depending on the protocol of your choice and the group of IO pins you use.
The pins that are used for SPI can be found in the user manuals of the micro-controller and the pressure sensor you choose.


Pressure Sensor: Honeywell MPRLS0300YG00001BB
Micro-controller: STM32F429 DISCOVERY
